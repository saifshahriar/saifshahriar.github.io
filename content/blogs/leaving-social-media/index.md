TL;DR: I’m leaving social media for an indefinite(?) period and have no plans to
return anytime soon.

A Bit of Context
----------------
Since time is very important and I’ve realized how much of it I’ve been wasting
on social media(s). So, I’ve decided to ditch these platforms—and possibly
the digital world(?), too. However, for longest time, I was unable to do so, as
many of my courses required platforms like Facebook and other social networks.

But now, that’s no longer the case. Plus, **Google recently disabled my
10-year-old Gmail account**, which has made it easier to take this step. For
now, I have no intention of coming back anytime soon.

That said, I’ll still be using GitHub, SourceHut, and a few other platforms, so
I’m not disappearing from the digital space entirely.

How to Contact Me
=================
I could give you my IRC channel link, but I doubt any of you would know how to
use it. Lol. XD

Currently, I don’t use WhatsApp, Telegram, or any proprietary platform, so don’t
try contacting me there. Also, I’m switching from my GP phone number to an
international one, so you might as well be out of luck reaching me by my phone.


Here’s where you can reach me:
- Email: Saif Shahriar <sh.saif@proton.me>
- Signal: https://signal.me/#eu/XcI92uGsERqktYiWxykpWNHZ3Ku9REFz5BrrIDpKv8bqtPoZZTxLp7htm2r_eENG

I’ll post any updates on my website. If you care, follow the RSS feed:
